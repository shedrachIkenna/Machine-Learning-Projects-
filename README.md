# Machine-Learning-Projects-
This repository serves as a curated collection of projects showcasing my expertise in creating Machine Learning Models

The following are the data analysis projects contained in this repo
- [Heart Disease Prediction Model](https://github.com/shedrachIkenna/Machine-Learning-Projects-/tree/main/Heart_prediction_model)


## Heart Disease Prediction Model 
The goal of this project is to develope a model that predicts whether an individual has had a heart attack based on the available attributes. This will help in early diagnosis and intervention, potentially saving lives and reducing healthcare costs
